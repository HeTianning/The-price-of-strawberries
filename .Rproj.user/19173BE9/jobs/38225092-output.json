Using a dataset containing variables such as current price, old price, and month, a Bayesian regression model was applied to analyze the relationships between pricing strategies, seasonal trends, and vendor-specific practices. Results reveal significant price variation among suppliers, with old price showing a strong positive correlation with current price, reflecting the impact of prior pricing strategies on current prices. Seasonal trends captured by the month variable indicate subtle but consistent fluctuations in pricing, highlighting the influence of supply and demand dynamics. These findings provide actionable insights into supplier-specific pricing strategies and market behavior, offering valuable guidance to consumers and stakeholders in the Canadian strawberry market.'\n  bibliography:\n    - references.bib\n  \n"]
