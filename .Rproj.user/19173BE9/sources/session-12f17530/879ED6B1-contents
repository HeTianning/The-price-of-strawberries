# Berry Markets Uncovered: Analyzing Strawberry Pricing Strategies Across Canadian Vendors

## Overview

This repo contains the analysis of strawberry pricing strategies across Canadian grocery vendors using data sourced from the Project Hammer dataset. The study employs a Bayesian linear regression model to examine how vendor identity, original price, seasonal trends, and promotional strategies influence the current price of strawberries. The dataset includes detailed pricing information from major Canadian vendors, offering a comprehensive perspective on market dynamics and pricing variability across regions and time. This approach aims to uncover the key factors driving strawberry prices and provides insights into vendor-specific strategies, seasonal pricing fluctuations, and the role of promotions in shaping consumer behavior.
